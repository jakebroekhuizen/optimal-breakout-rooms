In the era of remote learning and a world where teaching and instruction occurs in 'breakout' rather than 'class' - rooms, assigning breakout rooms from a teachers perspective can be challenging. As part of a CS170 UC Berkeley CompSci assignment, my partner and I were tasked with creating an algorithm that assigned N students to breakout rooms in an optimal manner, where "optimal" in this context refers to maximizing the total happiness and minimizing the total stress across breakout room assignments.

-Each student feels a fixed level of happiness (numerically defined between 0-100) towards being in a room with another student
-Each student feels a fixed level of stress (numerically defined between 0-100) towards being in a room with another student
